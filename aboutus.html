        <h2>What is "Almost Autistic"?</h2>
        <p>
 
            We are a passionate group of high school students from SMA Wardaya driven by a shared love for innovation, creativity and environmental issues, particularly in the ocean. As a team participating in Web Development Competition organized by HMIF Universitas Sriwijaya, our goal is to create and build a website as a solution that are not only functional but also impactful for existing problems. <br><br> 
 
            We aim to create digital solutions that contribute to one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations, which is No 14 about Life Below Water. With backgrounds ranging from coding and design to research and problem-solving, we blend our diverse skills to tackle complex challenges in making this website. <br><br>
 
            With the theme "Future Web: Developing Sustainable Digital Solutions", we would like to overcome global challenges based on SGG no 14, i.e. the plastic pollution in the oceans all over the world. We would like to promote people to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. This includes reducing marine pollution, protecting marine and coastal ecosystems and sustainable management of fisheries, including maintaining marine biodiversity. <br><br>
